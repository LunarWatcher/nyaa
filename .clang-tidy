# Notes:
# - clang-analyzer-optin.core.EnumCastOutOfRange: Useful, complains about std::filesystem::file_size for no fucking reason
# - clang-analyzer-cplusplus.NewDeleteLeaks: borked (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/55219)
# - bugprone-narrowing-conversions: There's so many conversions particularly between doubles and floats that it simply isn't feasible to keep up with 
#       clangd's extra pendantic check. The compiler does the bulk of the useful checks with -Wall
# - clang-diagnostic-unused-private-field: Maybe useful eventually, but not right now.
